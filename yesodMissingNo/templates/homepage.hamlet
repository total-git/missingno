<h1>Welcome to Missingno!

This game is a text adventure in the tradition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zork">Zork</a>, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colossal_Cave_Adventure">Colossal Cave Adventure</a> and the like.<br>

In the game you are prompted for a text input to interact with the world. You can enter an action (e.g. <code>go</code>) and an object (e.g. <code>north</code>) which would lead to <code>go north</code>. Note that some commands like <code>inventory</code> do not take an object.<br>
